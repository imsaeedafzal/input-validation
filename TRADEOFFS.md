# Tradeoffs

## Pros

- It is perfectly suited for validating REST requests and building single-page applications
- Form definition can easily be serialized as JSON for client-side validation and form rendering with JavaScript
- Small code footprint and very fast
- Easy to write unit tests for
- Part of the Symlex framework stack for agile Web development

## Cons

- It is not backed by a company and has a small community (you're welcome to join us)
- Development is mostly driven by a [single developer](https://blog.liquidbytes.net/about/)
- Does not render any HTML by itself (you can use any template engine and iterate over the fields though)
- Don't use it if you are not comfortable reading at least small amounts of library code (you're welcome to ask for 
  help via email or send additional docs as pull request)
